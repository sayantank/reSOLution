# reSOLution - Stake on Your Goals

Resolution is a Solana-based dApp that helps you commit to your goals by putting your money where your mouth is. Stake SOL on your resolutions and earn rewards for achieving them!

## How It Works

1. **Create a Resolution**
   - Set a resolution with a specific goal and timeframe
   - Stake SOL tokens as commitment
   - Choose 3 unique approvers who will verify your achievement
   - Your stake is automatically delegated to a Solana validator

2. **Earn While You Achieve**
   - Your staked SOL earns staking rewards during the resolution period
   - Stay motivated knowing your money is on the line

3. **Complete Your Resolution**
   - Get approval from your chosen verifiers
   - Need at least all 3 approvers to confirm completion

4. **Outcome**
   - **Success**: Receive back your initial stake + all staking rewards
   - **Failure**: Get back only your initial stake, rewards are burned ðŸ”¥

## Features
